# Sanity CMS Guide for theProject

This guide will help you understand how to use Sanity CMS to manage your blog content.

## What is Sanity?

Sanity is a headless CMS that stores your content in a cloud-based backend. Your website fetches this content using the Sanity API. This separation allows you to manage content independently from your website's code.

## Accessing Sanity Studio

1. Go to https://www.sanity.io/login
2. Log in with your credentials
3. Select your project (named "theProject" or similar)
4. You'll be taken to Sanity Studio, where you can manage your content

### Editing Existing Posts
