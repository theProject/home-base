## Mission & Values

**theProject** is tech evangelism with humility — a place for the *imposters with good intent*.  
We build, learn, and share in public so others can level-up with us.

On our blog you’ll find:

- 🎮 **Game Development** — behind-the-scenes on our in-house titles  
- 💻 **Web Dev & Industry** — opinions and deep dives on modern stacks  
- 🤖 **AGI / AI Frontier** — bold discussions as we race toward artificial general intelligence  
- 🚀 **Frontier Innovation** — risky experiments and lessons learned  

Whether you’re a curious newbie or a seasoned pro, you’ve got a seat at our table.

## 🤝  For Our Dev Friends

Curious how the sausage gets made? We push the **bleeding edge** on purpose:

- *Why Next 15 & React 19?* — App Router + the new React compiler goodness  
- *Why Tailwind 4?* — lightning-fast builds & modern design tokens  
- *Why Payload?* — self-hosted TypeScript CMS with powerful blocks  
- *Why Neon?* — serverless Postgres without cold-start pain  
- *Why Vercel Blob?* — zero-config object storage on the same edge network  

We share real stories: from “it just shipped” wins to “wow that bug hurt” post-mortems.  
Hack on a similar stack? Open an issue or PR — let’s learn together.

### Asset Notes

1. Place your SVGs in an `assets/` folder (or adjust the paths above).  
2. GitHub renders SVGs natively, so no extra steps needed.  

Enjoy — and welcome to **theProject**!
